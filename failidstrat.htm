<hr>

<p>One of the most common causes of destructive confrontation strategies is the inadequate
identification of available options for dealing with the situation. Often this is due to
the parties' limited skills. Most often, parties only consider options they are familiar
with and good at. Lawyers tend to litigate, mediators tend to mediate, warriors tend to
wage war. While this rule is violated on occasion, people usually stick with the
approaches that they are most comfortable with and experienced in using. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, at least in the U.S., there seem to be many more people who are skilled
in force-based approaches to conflict than there are with skills in transformative,
constructive alternatives. This results in an excessive reliance on force-based strategies
involving interpersonal threat, hard-ball politics, no-holds-barred litigation, and, all
too often, violence. Not until many more people are exposed to and trained in
unconventional and more constructive power options--such as effective persuasion,
nonviolent action, coalition-building, and constructive political activism--will
force-based strategies recede from their current dominance in intractable conflict
confrontations. </p>

<p>While force-based strategies have problems, too much reliance on softer strategies also
can cause problems. For instance, mediators and negotiators often overlook limitations to
negotiated agreements. One such limit is the &quot;BATNA limit,&quot; (referring to Fisher
and Ury's term BATNA, or &quot;best alternative to a negotiated agreement.&quot;) The
BATNA limit refers to the problem that parties will not negotiate a settlement to a
conflict that is highly important--as intractable conflicts usually are--if they believe
that they have an alternative that will yield a better outcome than the negotiated
settlement. They will also not negotiate fundamental values, rights, or identity issues.
These are inherently non-negotiable. Negotiation also does not work if one side has little
to offer the other side, or when the power differential between the parties is high.</p>

<p>Likewise, integrative strategies have limits too. The most important is time. &nbsp;
Integrative approaches are usually very slow. They take months, even years to accomplish,
while force based strategies may be much quicker. For this reason, it is important to
assess all the strategies available, and the costs and benefits of each before one
strategy or set of strategies is chosen.</p>
